# hello-world
This repository is for practicing GitHub for CPSC 2100
I am Paul Ferris.
I enjoy collecting rocks
If a rock is too big to collect, I also enjoy climbing therefore it is a win-win.
I also enjoy longboarding throughout the city instead of driving directly to my destinations to see all of the cool hidden gems around town.
